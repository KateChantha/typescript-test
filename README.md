## Note
#### Type definition file
- when warning - Could not find a declaration file for module 'faker'
- means missing definition of type in the library
- need install type definition file, some library already includes typedefinition so no need to install
- search for @types/faker on npm --> most come from DefinitelyTyped project
- see faker type definition file in node_module/@types/faker/index.d.ts

#### Interface as a gate keeper
- see example in miniApp.ts
